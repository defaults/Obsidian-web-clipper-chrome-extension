# Obsidian web clipper chrome extension
*[Obsidian web clipper bookmarklet](https://gist.github.com/kepano/90c05f162c37cf730abb8ff027987ca3) rebuilt as chrome extension.*

This extention is just a repackaging of amazing work from @kepano so all credits to him. This is born out of my necessity as I use Arc and it does not support Bookmarklet. 

Bugs 
- Extention works but you get "unexpected export ..." for readability.js and turndown_service.js last line of code. I dont know JS much and could not solve it. But Hey it works! Send a pull request if anyone can fix it. Thanks!

Steps to use
- git pull
- goto Chrome/Chromium -> Extentions -> enable "developer mode"
- drop /chrome extention to Extentions page
- Volla!

Things still remaining to do
- publish as extention on Chrome store
- create a Firefox and maybe Safari extention

Feature I wish to add
- when clipping same webpage next time, instead of new note, append the clipping to old note with metadate (as section with date added?)
- maybe a page for extention to configure things (but will prefer simplicity)
